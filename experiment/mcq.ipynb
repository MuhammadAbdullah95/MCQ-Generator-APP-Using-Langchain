Davenport and DJ Patil declared \"Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century\",[26] a catchphrase that was picked up even by major-city newspapers like the New York Times[27] and the Boston Globe.[28] A decade later, they reaffirmed it, stating that \"the job is more in demand than ever with employers\".[29]\\n\\nThe modern conception of data science as an independent discipline is sometimes attributed to William S. Cleveland.[30] In a 2001 paper, he advocated an expansion of statistics beyond theory into technical areas; because this would significantly change the field, it warranted a new name.[25] \"Data science\" became more widely used in the next few years: in 2002, the Committee on Data for Science and Technology launched the Data Science Journal. In 2003, Columbia University launched The Journal of Data Science.[25] In 2014, the American Statistical Association\\'s Section on Statistical Learning and Data Mining changed its name to the Section on Statistical Learning and Data Science, reflecting the ascendant popularity of data science.[31]\\n\\nThe professional title of \"data scientist\" has been attributed to DJ Patil and Jeff Hammerbacher in 2008.[32] Though it was used by the National Science Board in their 2005 report \"Long-Lived Digital Data Collections: Enabling Research and Education in the 21st Century\", it referred broadly to any key role in managing a digital data collection.[33]\\n\\nThere is still no consensus on the definition of data science, and it is considered by some to be a buzzword.[34] Big data is a related marketing term.[35] Data scientists are responsible for breaking down big data into usable information and creating software and algorithms that help companies and organizations determine optimal operations.[36]',\n",
